# Todo

## Grafana Setup

### Get the image renderer working with git sync.

* It'd be cool to show off git sync and PRs with rendered images.
    * It seems to work in a dashboard, I can "export as image"
    * Git Sync is not detecting it, though

### Get a MongoDB plugin working

* This is required for the Marathon dashboards
* Either the enterprise one (and tolerate the license errors), or this one: https://github.com/haohanyang/mongodb-datasource

### Get git sync automated

* I found the Repository object
* Need a way to pre-load the credentials

## Presentation Setup

* Need to review the look and feel.
* Need to add content

## Dashboards

### Mortgage dashboard

* Add generated data to google sheets and connect that dashboard
    * Add a way to pre-create the google sheets data source?
* Add house image
* Add house value API using the infinity data source

### Marathon dashboards

* Import
* Play more (yay)
* Improve the visualizations
* Game summary and overall summary pages

### House dashboard

* Get Home Assistant running again
